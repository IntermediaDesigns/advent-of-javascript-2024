    - Several years ago, I created a YouTube Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ6RNln3fgo on how to solve this challenge. The video is a bit outdated, but the content is still relevant. The final code is available on GitHub https://github.com/selfteachme/0032-Animating-Password-Input.working through this exact challenge. Even though it’s a few years old, the content is still relevant. The final code is available on GitHub.
