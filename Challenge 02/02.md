When the input is expanded, you should be able to search for the movie you want. Your input should limit the list of movies displays. When hovering over a specific movie, the background changes to blue.

Depending on your skill level, you can make this challenge as easy or as difficult as you'd like:

- Level 1: Style the custom dropdown and hard code in the list of movies
- Level 2: Load all 100 movies dynamically, from the provided JSON file
- Level 3: Don't forget accessibility! Use arrow keys to select a specific movie

## Getting Started

1. Download the project files. This includes:
   - Movie Thumbnail Images (if you want to hard code the menu options)

4. Once you're finished, share your work using #adventofjs

## FAQs

### Can I use libraries / frameworks on these projects?

Of course! This is also a good opportunity to challenge yourself and experiment with something new.

### Oh no! I'm stuck!

With this challenge, you have a couple of options:

- Comment on this challenge within Podia. As a community, let's help each other out.

### Can I use this project in my portfolio?

Sure! But, be honest about the work that you did.

Merry Coding,
