When the input is expanded, you should be able to search for the movie you want. Your input should limit the list of movies displays. When hovering over a specific movie, the background changes to blue.

Depending on your skill level, you can make this challenge as easy or as difficult as you'd like:

- Level 1: Style the custom dropdown and hard code in the list of movies
- Level 2: Load all 100 movies dynamically, from the provided JSON file
- Level 3: Don't forget accessibility! Use arrow keys to select a specific movie
