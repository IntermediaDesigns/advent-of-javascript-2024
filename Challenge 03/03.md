## Requirements
* As you text into the text area, it should grow to accommodate the amount of text.
* If you pass in a default value, it should resize the initial display for the default amount of content.
* *There aren't any project files for today's challenge.*

**Bonus**: Convert this into reusable code. For example, if you're using React convert this into a custom hook.

## Getting Started
1. You're more than welcome to use any framework you'd like.
2. Happy coding!
3. Once you're finished, share your work using #adventofjs
